# Final Review:

Overall the software is a very hand it let you all the communication the network, so if you connected to a wireless access point you can see all the traffic coming from user on the network. Understanding how normal traffic look like is important so you know if something going wrong on your network, like with a DDos attack there is a specific type of format you can identify just by looking, DDos attack is a flood of the same traffic.

# Pro:

* Free software.
* Available for multiple platforms â€“ Windows & UNIX.
* Can see detailed information about packets within a network.
* Not proprietary can be used on multiple vendors.

# Cons

* Wireshark requires elevated privileges, which can either be bad or good depending on your perspective.
* It has the standard disadvantage of capturing packets that might not reflect actual network traffic because the data is captured locally.
* It can be confusing for new users to see all the columns and colors.
